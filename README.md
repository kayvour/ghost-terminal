# GhostTerminal 🧑‍💻

A lightweight, movie-style "hacker terminal" web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Type anything and watch cinematic code snippets stream to the screen in real time — like you’re hacking into the mainframe.

🌐 [Live Demo](https://kayvour.github.io/ghost-terminal/)

## 📝 What It Does

GhostTerminal is a terminal-style interface that:

- Mimics the look and feel of a green-on-black hacker terminal
- Reacts to every keypress by displaying randomized, code-like output
- Gives off that *movie hacking scene* vibe for fun, portfolio, or aesthetic

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎬 Typing triggers realistic-looking code lines from a customizable `snippets.txt`
- 🖥️ Terminal-like UI with blinking cursor, glowing text, and matrix-style background
- 🧠 Boot-up sequence to simulate system initialization
- 🎨 Modern CSS styling, scroll-less terminal, and CRT-style glow
- 📝 Easily extendable via an external text file (`snippets.txt`)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghostterminal.git

    const socket = new WebSocket(ip);
   }
   sudo rm -rf /
   encryptPayload(payload);

3. **Preview locally:**
   Just open index.html in your browser. No backend needed.
